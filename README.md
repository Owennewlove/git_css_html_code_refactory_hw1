# Git, CSS, & Html Code Refactory

## Description

The provided Html sheet was cluttered and did not contain many semantic elements, therefore, I added quality semantic to the Html. Once the Html had been changed, the Css style sheet needed to match in order to alleviate code breaks. The provided Css sheet was also littered with redundancies, so much consolidation was needed. The overall purpose of building this website was to refactor the provided code into a configuration that is easier to read and run. 


## Table of Contents (Optional)
