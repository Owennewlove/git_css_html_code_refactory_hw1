# Git, CSS, & Html Code Refactory

## Description

The provided Html sheet was cluttered and did not contain many semantic elements, therefore, I added quality semantic to the Html. Once the Html had been changed, the Css style sheet needed to match in order to alleviate code breaks. The provided Css sheet was also littered with redundancies, so much consolidation was needed. The overall purpose of building this website was to refactor the provided code into a configuration that is easier to read and run. 


## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)

## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
